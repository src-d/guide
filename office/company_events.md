# source{d} Events

## Get togethers
Once a month we organise a get together where we either all go to a bar where free drinks will be served from 19:00-24:00 or we go for some group activities like salsa classes, karting or other fun stuff. That means, every Get together can be different and always depends on the activity.
Some activities let us be more flexible (beers) while others have to follow a specific schedule (classes). We can generalize:
  - The event is on the calendar from now to forever, it is the third Wednesday of the month.
  - The starting time usually is around 7 pm and the duration is around 2-3 hours. If the activity is only 1 hour (like a Yoga class) we will add some beers after that. 
  - The goal of this event is to increase the knowledge within the team. The minimun amount of people is 35% - 40% of the employees. If we see there are not a lot of people joining because of the date (not because of the activity) we will try to change it to be able to put together more people.
  - We will tell you if the activity is only for sourcerers or your +1s are also invited to join. If the plan is beers,         your +1s are included by default.  
  - We try to do something nice and cool without being overpriced but we donâ€™t have a specific budget since each get together is different.
  - Check out our [history of past get togethers](get_together_history.md)
  - Feel free to suggest ideas (reasonable ones) in Slack channel, #get-together, we will check if it is viable for us.
 

## Friday Lunchs
Once a month we organise a Friday lunch at the office. It is the fourth Friday of the month. Every sourcerer is invited to join. We order food (different every month) for everybody and we share good moments together. 

## Birthday cakes
Shared calendar `KinHR` includes birthdays of all sourcerers. Every time there is an event in that calendar - if a person is present at Madrid's offce, a cake is going to be shared at the kitchen on that day, around 17:00. If the birthday is on weekend, the cake will happen on Monday. 

Although this is a tradition at Madrid's office, everyone in the company including people who work remote is very welcome to join either at the kitchen or at https://appear.in/sourced-birthday

## Summer Party
The source{d} summer party is hosted once a year in the months of June, July or September (depending on travel schedules). 

The reason for this party to exist is just celebrating how awesome summer is and because it's a good excuse to have some fun together. Everyone in the company and their +1s are invited to join.

We usually book a place where snacks will be served as well as free drinks. Sometimes we organize some group activities before the party starts, so the starting time varies.

The party lasts until the last person standing can't take it anymore and leaves. After such a tough night if you feel up for it, we'd love to see you working on Friday, if you don't, no worries, come in later or stay at home.

## Christmas Party
The source{d} Christmas party is hosted once a year in December. It's basically the winter version of the summer party where we gather to celebrate the end of another awesome year. Everyone in the company and their +1s are invited to join.

We usually book a place where snacks will be served as well as free drinks. Sometimes we organize some group activities before the party starts, so the starting time varies. A few weeks before the party we start a Secret Santa and the give out the presents during the party.

The party lasts until the last person standing can't take it anymore and leaves. After such a tough night if you feel up for it, we'd love to see you working on Friday, if you don't, no worries, come in later or stay at home.

## Off-sites
Once a year we organize an off-site where we take the whole company for a two-day trip to a rural house near Madrid. There we organize tech talks with people from outside of source{d} as well as hackathons.

Thanks to a nice pool, BBQ and a lot of beer and drinks it's a great mix of fun + learning experience.
