# Expenses & Travel

We don't like to put strict rules in terms of what you can expense and what not, because we believe that you will treat the company's money in a responsible way. An easy way to achieve this is by following these principles:<br>
* Spend source{d}'s money as if it was your own.
* Research all available alternatives to make sure you're getting the best value for money.
* Always ask your manager first before making a purchase since there might be a better option available.
* Once the decision has been made please request Esther to make the purchase, so that she can keep track of inventory as well as keep the receipt.
* If you need any hardware for work, make sure to check our [Hardware list](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/available_hardware.md) and ask Esther to buy anything you need.
* If you see yourself in the situation of needing to pay something out of your own pocket please make sure that you keep all the receipts and hand them over to Esther for her to do the reimbursement. You should fill in the [expenses sheet](https://docs.google.com/a/sourced.tech/spreadsheets/d/1efa5uU1b95FzxhqRPcUOF1UOiAa1j0i08ae15y22J6c/edit?usp=sharing) with the amount in EUR to be sure that the reimbursment is done properly. If it's a physical item, make sure to give it to her when you receive it for her to update the inventory. 
  
## What expenses will source{d} reimburse?
* Mileage will be paid when driving your own car to a work meeting outside of the office. The rate will be 0,17â‚¬/km as established by Spanish law.
* Public transportation or Cabify/Uber/Lyft/Taxis taken to work related meetings/events.
* Meals that are work related. Meals with other sourcerers are not included here.
* Books, online courses, conferences or anything else related to education.

## What expenses are covered when travelling?
* Lodging, which will be organized by Esther. If you decide to stay with family or friends we will pay you 50% of what your lodging would've cost!
* Plane/Train/Bus tickets, which will be purchased by Esther. Please let her know with as much time in advance as possible so that she can find the best deals.
* Meals will be reimbursed. Here again, try to follow the principle of spending the money as if it was your own.
* Public transportation, Ubers, Lyfts or Taxis will be paid only when going to a work meeting/event or when going back to the lodging from one of these as stated above.
* If you want to take some holidays and stay any extra days in a concrete location it's totally fine, but source{d} will only cover the costs of the days you stayed there for work. Any increase in the price of the plane ticket will also need to be covered by you.

## Are conferences covered?
* It depends on if they are compulsory or not. In the case of you having to go to a conference without being given the option not to, it will be considered a work trip and hence the above expenses will be covered.
* If you go to a voluntary conference but submit a paper to give a talk and it gets accepted, it will also count as a work trip and all the above expenses will be covered.
* If you go to a voluntary conference as an attendee only the plane, hotel and conference tickets will be covered. The reasoning behind this is that it's not an obligation, but a perk already.
