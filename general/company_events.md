# source{d} Events

## Get togethers
Once a month we organise a get together where we either all go to a bar where free drinks will be served from 19:00-24:00 or we go for some group activities like salsa classes, karting or other fun stuff. Every sourcerer and their +1s are invited to join.

## Summer Party
The source{d} summer party is hosted once a year in the months of June, July or September (depending on travel schedules). 

The reason for this party to exist is just celebrating how awesome summer is and because it's a good excuse to have some fun together. Everyone in the company and their +1s are invited to join.

We usually book a place where snacks will be served as well as free drinks. Sometimes we organize some group activities before the party starts, so the starting time varies.

The party lasts until the last person standing can't take it anymore and leaves. After such a tough night if you feel up for it, we'd love to see you in the office on Friday, if you don't, no worries, come in later or stay at home.

## Christmas Party
The source{d} Christmas party is hosted once a year in December. It's basically the winter version of the summer party where we gather to celebrate the end of another awesome year. Everyone in the company and their +1s are invited to join.

We usually book a place where snacks will be served as well as free drinks. Sometimes we organize some group activities before the party starts, so the starting time varies. A few weeks before the party we start a Secret Santa and the give out the presents during the party.

The party lasts until the last person standing can't take it anymore and leaves. After such a tough night if you get drunk or were in the party until late hours you can recover by taking the next day off for free.

## Off-sites
Once a year we organize an off-site where we take the whole company for a two-day trip to a rural house near Madrid. There we organize tech talks with people from outside of source{d} as well as hackathons.

Thanks to a nice pool, BBQ and a lot of beer and drinks it's a great mix of fun + learning experience.
