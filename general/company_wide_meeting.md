### Company Wide Meeting

Every two weeks we hold a CWM (Company Wide Meeting) where the management team presents: 
* major updates from each team
* strategic thinking
* company wide relevant announcements
* high level financials (e.g. cash in bank, net burn rate)
* answers to questions (can be anonoymous by asking through the TypeForm: https://sourced.typeform.com/to/dJFJhb) 

The CWM are recorded for source{d} team members who are remote or unable to attend the meeting (see discussion here: https://github.com/src-d/company/issues/66)
