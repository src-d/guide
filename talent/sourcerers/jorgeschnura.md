**Work**
- What are you going to be doing at source{d}?
  - Eiso and me work closely together, but I take care of internal operations stuff like internal policies, commercialization, legal, etc. This changes every few months though as we evolve as a startup.

- If you could only save one programming language, which one would it be?
  - From the three that I've learnt it would probably be Python.

  - I guess source{d} doesn't count, so it would be Nvidia.

**Other**
- What are your hobbies and what do you like about them?
  - Videogames: I like to be transported to different worlds and get lost there. I prefer single-player games with deep stories and RPG elements. But I also like to play League of Legends with friends
  - Skiing: I love the sense of speed and skiing is for me the ultimate way to feel it
  - Eating: When I travel, I enjoy the food as much as the sights
- What was the last lie you told?
  - Can't remember tbh
- What was your first thought when you woke up this morning?
  - I woke up very early, so my first thought was not to make noise so that I wouldn't wake my wife up.
- What question do you hate to answer?
  - I generally dislike questions that are asked for the sake of asking when the person would take less time in figuring out the answer than in asking and listening to the reply.
- What’s your favorite knock-knock joke?
  - I'm never able to remind any jokes. Luckily, all my friends are quite good at it.
- If you could have a coffee with any person in the world, who would it be?
  - Colin Moriarty
- Would you like to share with us a story about yourself?
  - There's many, but one you probably don't know is that my oldest brother is the direct descendant of Quevedo (direct meaning only looking at the elder sibling in the genealogical line), one of the most important peots in Spanish history. But don't expect much poetry from me, those genes got lost somewhere on the way.
- What food do you like and dislike?
  - I like everything. I think it is important to learn to appreciate food in general, no matter what it is, for obvious reasons.
- What is your favorite quote?
  - Soy dueño de mis silencios y prisionero de mis palabras. I am the owner of my silences and the prisoner of my words
