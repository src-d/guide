## Questions to learn sourcerers better

According to research, it becomes harder to establish a personal relationship with other team members when working remotely.

In order to know you better, as a new member we would like you to reply a few personal questions, as well as share with us your social media accounts you are comfortable with. By doing so we can establish more personal relationships outside of work activities.

We have created a list of the questions and below are the instructions on how to successfully respond to the questions and make other members read them. If there are any questions you don't feel comfortable to answer, feel free to skip them.

- Copy the content of the [questions](questions.md)
- Create a new file (your_GitHub_username.md) in a new branch with your responses on the template you copied and create a Pull Request
- Your file should be placed in this folder
- You can merge your commit(s) after your answers have been approved and/or suggestions have been done, ideally in a few days so everyone will have the chance to read them, as the open PR provides more visibility. 

For people concerned about their privacy, they can instead create the Pull Request with their answers in the [company](https://github.com/src-d/company/tree/master/sourcerers) repository.
