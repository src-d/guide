# European Union Residents

Before we can make the hiring effective, our Office Manager will need to organise the issuing of three documents:
1. Temporary NIE (Foreigner Identification Number)
2. Final NIE (Foreigner Identification Number)
3. Social Security Number

## Provisional NIE:

Form 790: You will need to take it to a bank and specify that you want to pay the fee for the provisional NIE. Once paid, you will get a receipt taht needs to be kept. The closest bank to the office is [here](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Santander/@40.4223657,-3.6858236,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x422494ae2c4fcf12?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjo3ar4msvYAhWJWhQKHbICAbgQ_BIIfzAK) and the closest bank to the police station of the next step is [here](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Banco+Popular/@40.4611529,-3.6980035,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb58f048d9a341bee!8m2!3d40.4611529!4d-3.6980035).<br>

Form 15: you will need to go to the [police station](https://www.google.es/maps/place/General+Commissariat+for+Immigration+and+Borders/@40.461575,-3.696775,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc8e82acda1a01736?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-t8XKmsvYAhWGOhQKHWkHDlYQ_BIIigEwCg) (no appointment needed) and request a provisional NIE, stating that your purpose is to open a bank account. It is compulsory to present the Form 790 with the bank’s stamp and Form 15. A copy of the passport or ID, as well as the original are required.

The police needs around three days to generate the provisional NIE. They will provide a receipt with a date to go back to the [police station](https://www.google.es/maps/place/General+Commissariat+for+Immigration+and+Borders/@40.461575,-3.696775,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc8e82acda1a01736?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-t8XKmsvYAhWGOhQKHWkHDlYQ_BIIigEwCg) to get the provisional NIE.

## Social Security Number:
You have to go to the [Social Security Office](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Calle+de+Juan+Bravo,+49,+28006+Madrid/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4228b8c1b598ef:0xbe5b5cf59fbbb5cf?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDlIWLoMvYAhVLWhQKHWfBBaoQ8gEIJTAA) (no appointment needed) and ask for a “Número de afiliado”. Usually you have to wait around 1 hour. 
You’ll need to bring:
* Provisional NIE
* NAF Form
* ID or passport

Once this is complete, the hiring process will continue as described in the section for [Spanish residents](spanish_residents.md). 

## Definitive NIE (can be done in parallel with the rest of the process
The provisional NIE is only valid for three months. To get the definitive NIE, you have to get an appointment [here](https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/index.html) first. There the follwoing options must be chosen: "Madrid" → "Aceptar", 
"Certificados UE" → "Aceptar". Then you have to add your information, NIE, name, surname, phone, email, etc. Once this is done, an appointment receipt will be issued, which needs to be printed. The appointment will be in [this other police station](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Extranjeria+Ministerio+del+Interior/@40.3929124,-3.7687487,19z/data=!4m15!1m9!2m8!1sHotels!3m6!1sHotels!2s40.3929063,+-3.7680485999999997!3s0xd41886a34b1a3c5:0x11b380bf0104fce6!4m2!1d-3.7680486!2d40.3929063!3m4!1s0xd41886bcb2ab301:0xcb113ac8f40209ed!8m2!3d40.3930398!4d-3.7679122).<br>

The following documentation needs to be taken to the appointment:
* Form EX-18 (2 copies)
* Appointment receipt
* Passport or ID, both the original and a copy.
* Contract, original and copy.
* Form 790. This form must be taken to the bank before the appointment to pay the amount required for the definitive NIE.
