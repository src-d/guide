## Onboarding Process

- This document describes the onboarding process for a new source{d} member.

### Administrative

1. [For Spanish residents](spanish_residents.md)
2. [For EU residents](eu_residents.md)
3. [For Non-EU residents](Non-EU_residents.md)

### Guide 

Read the source{d} [guide](https://github.com/src-d/guide) which contains all the information necessary from the moment you accept an offer. 

### Hardware

- A few days before you start working with us, you choose the hardware you would like to use from the [list with the hardware we provide](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/available_hardware.md). 
- The first day we present it to you, so you are able to create your working environment as soon as possible.

### Accounts

From the first day you have access to source{d} Google Account, while receiving invitations to join the applications we are using:

* Slack: the main communication channel we are using. This is the [list with our slack channels](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/communication/slack_channels.md). 
* GitHub source{d}: you are added to our GitHub organization. The lead of your team is responsible to explain the repositories you need to be notified of and how to treat them.
* Lever: it's a platform to support our hiring process. Everyone has access to it in order to be able to review and give feedback on candidates. 
* Kin HR: if you want to ask days off that's the right place to do it. Also, every month you will receive the invoice of your payment through the platform. 
* Google Calendar: here are hosted all the events. Give to our Office Manager access to your calendar in order to add the events to it. Make sure you check your calendar frequently. 

- The above are the main tools we are using, but we do have a full [list with our general tools](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/tools.md).

### Welcome Talks

During your first week you are going to have Welcome Talks in order to get to know source{d} and every team better:

* Welcome talks with the Founders
* Welcome talk with the Head of Architecture
* Welcome talk with the VP of Developer Relations
* Welcome talk with the Product Manager


### Company Events

- We regularly organize [company events](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/office/company_events.md) and you will be notified about them on your Google Calendar. 

### Remote guidelines

- As you know, source{d} is fully remote friendly, what this means is that you can choose to be full-time remote from the location of your choice or be in our Madrid or San Francisco office. For smooth collaboration, we have everything written down in our [guideline](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/remote/remote_guidelines.md).

### Meetings

- Minutes of meetings should be taken at every meeting (with very few exceptions) to allow for transparency to the people who attended to it as well as to those who haven't attended to it. All of them are stored in our private [minutes](https://github.com/src-d/minutes) repo. Minutes should be opened as a Pull Request and stay open for a minimum of 2 days to gather feedback.

### GeekBot

- On Slack we have GeekBot which asks on daily basis a few questions like what you accomplished the previous day, what are you going to work on today and where are you working from. The bot displays your response in the relevant Slack channels. It actually organises asynchronous stand up meetings and keeps our team synced. As people work on different things or/and from different places, it's helps us being transparent and know what everyone is doing. 

### Flexible Schedule

- Set your own schedule but be aware that there might be meetings in which you are required. In general, most people start between 9.00-11am local time.

### Team Page

- When a new member joins source{d}, we add their picture that will be taken the first week on the [team page](https://sourced.tech/team/). If someone doesn't want to use a picture, a placeholder image will be used instead.

### Working from an Office

In case you choose to work from one of our offices:

At the Madrid office, we provide:

* Kitchen with refrigerator and microwaves. Coffee, milk, fruits, drinks, ice creams etc.
* HTC Vive VR Headset, Xbox One and Nintendo 64 with a nice catalog of games. 
* Boxes to store your personal items.

- In case you don't know how to use any of the electronics feel free to ask the person who might there with you. 
- For any issues you may notice in terms of condition or lacking supplies, please contact our Office Manager.

#### Madrid Conference Rooms

- There are three rooms that you are able to use for your meetings: Ada Lovelace, Dennis Ritchie, and Alan Turing. 
- Every room contains a camera, microphone, and screens you are able to use if you have remote meetings. Also, you will notice small tablets, that allow you to connect easily through Zoom. 
- We are using Google Calendar with the room names to book them in order to avoid any conflicts. 

At the San Francisco office, we provide:

* Kitchen with refrigerator and microwaves.
* Lots of interesting people around, since we are working out of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).

#### San Francisco Conference Rooms

- Since we're sharing the space with Holberton, we are able to make use of the conference rooms when necessary, but they can't be reserved.

### Know the Team Better

#### Sourcerers Matchup 

- On our Slack there is a bot named Donut to help us get to know each other better. The bot randomly pairs everyone in #sourcerers-matchup channel every 2 weeks on Monday and encourage them to meet for a videocall or at the kitchen. Every new member is up to decide if wants to be part of the matchup or not.

#### Sourcerers Q&As

- We have created a list of a few personal [questions](https://github.com/src-d/guide/tree/master/talent/sourcerers#questions-to-learn-sourcerers-better) that every team member can reply on GitHub. By doing so we can establish more personal relationships outside of work activities within the team.

### Open Source Days

- Every two Mondays each member of the team is dedicating their time in working on open source projects of personal interest. The calendar ```Remote & OSD``` displays which Monday is an [OSD](../open_source_days.md) at source{d}.
