# Open Source Days

Developers at source{d} dedicate 10% of their development time to Open Source projects of their choice.
This is accomplished with Open Source Days (OSD) every two weeks, on Mondays.

## The Rules

### Open Source Everything

The result of OSD MUST be Open Source, whether it is code, prose, a dataset or a [beer recipe](https://github.com/src-d/homebrew). We generally use public GitHub repositories for this. They can be either in a personal account, a dedicated organization or the [src-d organization](https://github.com/src-d).

### DON'T do your job

OK. Actually, OSD is part of every source{d} developer's job. But the decision on what to do
on OSD should be driven exclusively by your interests. While you can work on a source{d} project such as
[go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git), we also encourage you to work on something not related
to your daily job.

## How To

1. **Share your plan.** You should briefly explain what you are going to do and what do you expect to accomplish by the end of the day. Explanations about the project you're going to contribute are done in the `#osd` slack channel, in the beginning of the day.
2. **Do it.** Execute your plan for the day and push it!
3. **Presentation.** At the end of the day, everyone presents their work in the `#osd` slack channel with the corresponding source code and description.
