# Hiring Process Explained

This document explains the internal hiring process at source{d} and the responsibilities for each person related to it.

### Job Description

- The Job Description is written by the lead engineers with the Talent's Manager support.

- For every meeting between the lead and the Talent Manager there will be a PR in the [minutes](https://github.com/src-d/minutes) repo and the job descriptions will be uploaded at the private repository https://github.com/src-d/company.

- The CTO and CEO should be added as reviewers (but should pause the process in case of delay in reviewing).

- The Talent Manager posts the job description through Lever on the source{d} website.

### Sourcing

- Lead engineers are responsible for identifying people to be contacted and other sourcing channels such as niche job boards.

- At any given moment the Talent Manager is able to drop in and work on finding more developers.

- Developer lists/sourcing channels should continuously be defined and refreshed after communication between the Talent Manager and the leads.

- The Talent Manager is responsible for working with the Developer Relations team in order to gain people through community actions (Twitter/Blog etc.).

### First Contact

- Any developer should be contacted by the lead engineers after together defining the outgoing message. It's a motivating factor for the developers to be contacted by the lead engineers and has shown in the past to have a significantly higher engagement rate.

- If the lead engineers are not able to send the emails to the developers they are interested in, the Talent Manager should do that and copy the lead engineers in every email.

### Screening

- If the developer is an applicant, they should be accepted/rejected by the lead engineers during the screening phase.

- If the developer is approached by us from a specific source (known from meetups, having worked together in the past,  etc.), they should move forward to the next step as it means that the leads have already shown interest.

### First Skype/Zoom/Phone Interview

- A quick Skype/Phone/Zoom call should be available to every developer who is interested in the roles*. It is a general discussion to know more about the background and experience of the developer as well as to share as much as possible from our side about the team & company.

\* There are notable exceptions to this, such as higher volume junior roles where we directly ask the developer to do the coding challenge before a call.

- Lead engineers are responsible to make the calls as it's a motivating factor for the developers. Leads will also be able to assess early in the process if the interview process should continue or not.

### Coding Challenges

- Every developer who passes the first Skype interview should complete the coding challenge.

- In case of the Machine Learning team, there is an additional ML task necessary to be solved.

- Coding challenges are being sent to the developers by the Talent Manager and the results are being reviewed by the lead engineers.

- Coding challenge is currently available in Go, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Scala and Java. Other languages can be requested and we will consider the possibility of adding them.

- We recommend allocating five hours in a row to complete the coding challenge. Completion in one hour is possible but it is very exceptional.

### Final Round of Interviews
 
- This is the last step in which it's decided if the developer will receive an offer or not. It might last a full day or be split across two half-days, depending on the availability of the developer and team availability. The interviews are conducted either on-site or remotely.

- The interviews are the following:

* Kickoff with the VP of Engineering. Duration 60'.
* QA: to know the developer better. Two interviewers should participate; one from the team that the developer is being interviewed for, and one from any other engineering or non engineering team (eg. Product, Talent). Duration 60'.
* Design interview: to see how the developer would design a solution to a given technical problem working with several of our engineers. Each team has specific needs that should be properly covered during this interview. The interviewers are chosen by the lead of the team the developer is interviewed for. Duration 90'.
* Logical thinking: to see how the developer solves an abstract problem in a logical way. At the moment is conducted by the Lead of Data Science, however it would be convenient to pass the knowledge of this interview to others for the future. Duration 60'.

- The interviewing schedule is decided on Lever by the Talent Manager, who collaborates with the leads when necessary to identify the interviewers.

- In case of rejection, the developer should be notified in person on the day by the lead of the corresponding team on why they were rejected. This should be a constructive discussion giving the developer as much insights as possible. If the interviews last for more than one day, the developer might be rejected at any given day.

### Offer

- The offer is being sent by the CTO on Lever.

- The developer has no time deadline to accept/reject the offer. An exception to this rule is when multiple developers are being considered for an offer.

## Notes

### Exceptions

- There are exceptions to the above steps for internship roles. The first step in this case is the Coding Challenge and then a technical Skype interview. Also, we do not do a final round of interviews for interns unless one could join us as a full-time engineer.
- If a developer has applied to multiple roles, it will be determined either in the first interview or in the last round which team fits better.
 
### Feedback

- After the coding challenge, it's very important to obtain feedback from the VP of Engineering at each next step.
