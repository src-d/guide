## Relocation support

- source{d} is a fully-remote company where every member is allowed to work from the location of their choice. Nonetheless, we are always happy to have members joining us in our offices.

- For that, we are willing to help our team members relocate from another country, and offer support throughout the entire process to them and their family. 

source{d} provides:

- Flights to relocate to Madrid, including for family members, are paid by source{d}
- Hotel/Airbnb for the first 2 weeks of your stay in Madrid
- Reimbursement/direct payment of invoices for up to 2,000 Euros* for relocation-related expenses, such as:
  - Moving companies/shipping for furniture and boxes
  - Car rental or taxis

\* We would like to offer a higher amount in the future but for now we're still a startup and we hope this covers at least part of our new team members’ expenses.

### Other

- For the SF office, the amount will be on a case by case basis for inter-state relocations, until we fully determine it.
