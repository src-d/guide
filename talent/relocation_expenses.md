## Relocation support

- source{d} is a fully-remote company where every member is allowed to work from the location of their choice. Nonetheless, we are always happy to have members joining us in our offices.

- For that, we are willing to help our team members relocate from another country, and offer support throughout the entire process to them and their family. 

source{d} provides up to 2,000 Euros for relocation-related expenses for Madrid's office, including: 

* Moving process for furniture and boxes
* Car rental or taxis

- Flights, including family, have been decided to be covered by source{d} fully outside of the 2,000 Euro relocation budget.
- Additionally, for the first two weeks of your arrival in Madrid or SF, the company pays for the hotel/Airbnb stay.

### Other

- For the SF office, the amount will be on a case by case basis for inter-state relocations, until we fully determine it.

- We would like to offer a higher amount in the future but for now, we're still a startup and we hope this covers at least part of our member's expenses.

- All the invoices/receipts for the expenses should be presented to us.
