Software Engineer in the Data Retrieval team
------------------------------------------

### [Company](../company-section.md)

### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role 

- The Data Retrieval team is developing source{d}'s audacious high-level Engine for running scalable data retrieval pipelines that process and manipulate any number of code repositories for source code analysis. Written mostly in Scala, it aims to be robust, friendly and flexible: it is built on top of Apache Spark, accessible both via Scala and Python Spark APIs, and capable of running on large-scale distributed clusters over petabytes of data.

- We at source{d} seek to be at the heart of any project related to source code. Thus, this core tool will be used both in-house for building source{d}'s unique global scale open dataset of +60M code repositories for cutting-edge machine learning research, as well as used externally by empowering a wide community of developers, researchers and companies worldwide when doing vanguard research or building the next generation of developer tools and experiences.

- Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Scala coding skills and knowledge about Apache Spark aren't required but will be highly appreciated, in the other hand Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.

- We really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team's projects below:
- src-d/engine: running scalable pipelines that process any number of Git repositories
- go-git: a low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go
- śiva: seekable indexed block archiver format
- go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages

- If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.
