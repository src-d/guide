# Stock Option Plan
This is the place where you will find all the information regarding our Stock Option Plan.

### What are options?
An option is a contract that gives someone the right, but not the obligation, to buy a share at a specified price (strike price) within a specific time range or at a specific event.

### How do options work at source{d}?
At source{d} you receive options when you join the company as a way of making clear that you as well are an owner of this venture.<br>
source{d} options can be exercised in the case of a liquidity event.<br>
Depending on when you join, a strike price is defined, which will define how much you’ll need to “pay” to buy source{d} stock when you exercise your options.<br>

### What is a strike price?
The strike price is the price that you will agree to pay to exercise your options in the future. We currently set the strike price by applying a 20% discount over last round’s valuation, but this will change once we redomesticate to the U.S. There you need to perform a yearly valuation of the company by an external party to set this price.<br>
To be clear, whenever you’ll execute your options you won’t actually need to pay anything. On the contrary, you will receive the difference between your strike price and the share price of the liquidity event.

### What is a liquidity event?
A liquidity event could be an IPO or an acquisition by another party.<br>
An IPO (Initial Public Offering) means becoming a publicly traded company, listed on a stock exchange like Nasdaq. The share price to which the strike price would be compared would be that at which the company would start to trade.<br>
In the case of an acquisition the share price would be determined by the amount paid for the acquisition, divided by the total number of shares + options.

### How are options allocated?
We follow a formula that we apply to all positions in order for the allocation to be fair and scalable as we grow. It looks the following way:<br>
Options = (Team / Stage + Role) / 100

Team stands for which team you'll be working in. The weights are distributed this way:

Team | Weight
---- | ----
Data Science | 0.12
Developer Community | 0.12
Engineering | 0.1
Product | 0.1
Operations | 0.05

Stage stands for when you joined source{d}. Those who joined earlier had more risk than those who joined later:

Stage | Weight
----- | -----
Seed | 2
Series A | 4

Role represents how senior your position is. The more senior, the more responsibilities, the more options:

Role | Weight
---- | ----
VP | 0.37
Lead | 0.17
Senior | 0.07
Normal | 0.02
Junior | 0.00

### How many options have been given out?

Category | Absolute | Share
-------- | -------- | --------
Total Vested | 394 | 1.63%
Total Grantes | 1,084 | 4.44%
Total Outstanding | 684 | 2.80%
Total Options | 1,768 | 7.25%
Total Shares | 22,626 | 92.75%
Total Shares + Options | 24,394 | 100.00%
