This document clarifies the wage policy at source{d}.

- At source{d}, we have specified and clarified salary levels and we don't individually negotiate contracts. 

- The only exception applies to roles in which we have one only member, for instance, Head of Architecture. In these cases, we propose a salary after taking into account the current salary of the member and the competitive market salary levels. 

- Even though we have a transparent salary policy, we are not able to publicize the salaries of team members, whereas it's not legal in Spain.
