This document clarifies the wage policy at source{d}.

- At source{d}, we have a set salary for each level of engineering. This means we don't individually negotiate contracts. We believe this policy is more fair to candidates and existing team members. 

- We also believe that you do not have to grow to a management role to earn more, therefore we also have salary levels for individual contributors that can go above managers/leads.

- The only exception to salary levels is for roles in which we have only one member (for instance, Head of Architecture). In these cases, we propose a salary after taking into account the current salary of the member and the competitive market salary levels. 

- Even though we have a transparent salary policy, we are not able to publicize the salaries of team members, since it's not legal in Spain to do so.
