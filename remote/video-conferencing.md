# Zoom Video Conferenceing

At source{d} we use Zoom for video conferencing. We don't love it but it's the best tool we've found so far. Our requirements are the following:

- It needs to be stable and reliable
- It needs to support two screens
 - Why? We like to see the faces of the participants on one screen and the screenshared material on the other. Body language is important and this way you can screenshare and still see the people
- It needs have native applications for Mac, Linux, Android & iOS
