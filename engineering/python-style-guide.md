# source{d} Python Style Guide

1. Contributing to existing projects - do not change the style.
2. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with 99 char line length limit
3. Class methods order: first public, then protected (_), then private (__)
4. Use double quotes `"`. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string.
5. Do not use single letter argument names; use X and Y only in sklearn context.
6. docstrings: Sphinx style
