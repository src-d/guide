## Intro

This document describes the current development methodology followed by engineering.

We use individual, company, and team-level Kanban boards.
Therefore, the different phases of a cycle (e.g. planning, work, retrospective)
do not need to happen at the same time for all teams.

Meetings for high-level sync including product direction, vision, etc are
proactively scheduled by each Team Lead as needed. All Leads have periodical
hands-on meetings with the VP of Engineering.

## History

source{d} has gone through two major methodology changes:

* Initially, a partial scrum implementation was used.
* In 2017, we transitioned to a more complete scrum implementation.
* In 2018Q1 we replaced scrum with a simpler Kanban model, which is our current methodology.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

Management publishes OKRs at the beginning of every quarter. Starting from 2018Q2, OKRs are published in the [src-d/okrs](https://github.com/src-d/okrs) repository.

Each team is expected to publish its own OKRs, aligned with the company ones.
Engineering has team-level objectives, not individual ones. Only tasks in the backlog are expected to have individual assignees.

## Kanban

The Kanban board is a tool used to visualize work performed by a team
to better understand and optimize its flow of work.
([source](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban#kanban-boards))

Kanban relies upon full transparency of work and real-time communication of
capacity. Therefore the Kanban board should be seen as the single source of
truth for the team's work.

The Kanban columns are defined as follows:

### [Company Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/src-d/projects/9)

Column      | Description
------------|------------
Backlog     | Only contains Epics and user stories.
TODO        |
In Progress |
Done        |

### Team Kanban

Each team uses separate [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/src-d/projects/) as a Kanban board.

Teams managing issues across different Github Orgs (i.e Applications, Language Analysis) use the “add card” trick, described in [dear-github/dear-github#209](https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/209#issuecomment-357692288) to add issues from a different org.


Column           | Description
-----------------|------------
Backlog          | Break-down of the Epics for each product on actual tasks
TODO             | Tasks from backlog that are immediately ready to be acted on. Grooming a backlog to update this column is expected to be done on a daily basis by the Lead. See the Definition of TODO section below.
Development      | Task from TODO assigned to someone to work on.
Code Review (PR) | Issues that have PRs and are ready for Code Review.
Deploy/Release   | Things that are implemented/merged, but have not yet been “delivered” to the users. This can be seen as a next release's “backlog”. Releases themselves, although not trivial and documented <elsewhere>, are not expected to be handled in a separate issue.
Done             | A task is done, when a user can use the results of the work through an established interface: package manager for libs, online for web services, etc. See the section below [What does TODO mean?](#what-does-todo-mean).

On *"blockers"* - a task can be blocked at any stage of the development, so
there is no separate column and Tag is used instead to indicate something is
blocked.

More details in [Definition](#definition) section below.

### How to pick the next issues to work on?

Each team decides what works best for them. One effective way is picking tasks
from **right to left** in the Kanban board, ignoring issues already assigned or blocked.
A single person should not be in charge
of delivering the whole issue from Development to Done. That way knowledge is
better shared by the whole team.

For this to work properly, issues must be well documented so that anyone can understand
the issue, its context, and what will take to complete it.

## Leads Meeting

Same as something called SoS (Scrum of Scrums) before - a weekly meeting on Wednesdays 17:30
for the VP of Engineering, CTO and all team leads to catch up on ongoing progress.

The Leads Meeting is defined as a meeting  of the VP of Engineering with their
team, where CTO is invited to attend, to be synced with the daily basis developments.

Each team lead will prepare:

* A review of what has been done during the previous week.
* What are the things we are looking forward to? (re-prioritize things)
* Pitch new ideas from our workflow.

Then grooming company’s backlog/epics from [Company Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/src-d/projects/9) is conducted.

## Team Meeting

A bi-weekly meeting of the VP of Engineering with the team lead and optionally with the full
team (to be decided by the lead), in order to comment the status of the
projects. Scheduled with each team individually by VP of Engineering.

## Standup

All standups are happening online and asynchronously, per-team in the appropriate
`su-*` Slack channels. Standup reports are managed through Slack private messages with [geekbot](https://geekbot.io/).

## Demo

Demo meeting is a monthly event.

* Idea: let everybody know what's going on (on a quite technical level) that is relevant for others or affects others' releases/deployments.
* Product does not need to be deployed, but the demo should be as real as possible.
* Should be concise, respecting other people's time.
* Fixed max time **per-team: 15min (including questions)**. Agree between teams in advance, if more time needed.

## Keeping track of things

Github Projects board will be used as a Kanban board.

Teams managing issues across Github Org borders (Applications, Language Analysis) will use the “add card” trick, described in dear-github/dear-github#209 to add issues from different org to the team’s board.

Issues repositories:

* [src-d/issues-general](https://github.com/src-d/issues-general) - should be used more, as place for feedback/requests (i.e website, etc)
* [src-d/issues-infrastructure](https://github.com/src-d/issues-infrastructure) - issues/requests to Infrastructure team must be created here.

# Definitions

Below, we'll define the meaning of each Kanban column.

This is not a mere formality - it’s important to have the same things in mind when
moving work from one state to another and what is documented below is a
consensus that took a few hours to be reached among Engineering leads.

## What does TODO mean?

Something an engineer can immediately take and act upon. If the task is not
possible to start until another (well-known) task is finished first, this task
shall not be in TODO yet.

*Rationale* there are 2 goals we want to keep in mind while working with Kanban
board:

* as small TODO list on a Kanban as possible and
* tasks, moving fast from end-to-end of Kanban board (short Cycle Time)

This definition and goals also imply that leads should grooming backlog on a
daily basis.

> Alternative definition (discussed but discarded): all things that are planned to be done ASAP. This would imply that issues can be added to TODO in bulk at once, even in cases when multiple issues of a single project have known dependency on one another. Was discarded on the premise that it would go against the 2 goals, listed above.

## What does Done mean?

General mindset: Done always means that a user, both inside and outside source{d},
is able to use it through well-established interfaces. The exact definition may
vary per-team.

Few concrete examples, in case of work done on:

* Go library - it should be possible to use the particular version published on gopkg.in.
* Scala library - it should be possible to use it from Maven/sbt build
* Website/application - it should be accessible through a known (staging/production) environment URL
* etc


## What does Blocker mean?

*General mindset*: blocker means something **unexpected has happened**

Obvious/expected dependencies between a sequence of tasks don’t need to be marked
as blocked.

Issues from the backlog that can not be done, due to **a known dependency** should
**never** go into the TODO column (thus avoid being blocked). I am not able to
work on it anymore because it needs something done to move forward.

Things that are not *blockers*:

* change of priority (stop working on something for now)
* a known planned and expected issue (i.e dependency on another team’s work, that is handled in another issue
